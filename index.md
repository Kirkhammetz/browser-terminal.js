# Documentation

Incoming, need some spare time to write it.

## Placeholder

There are two bundle builded on the main Shell Class, _use only one_.

`termly.js`: Main class, init and build the shell with default value or custom value passed

`termly-prompt.js`: Simple DOM Wrapper around the Shell Class, you can write your own or use this for the sake of simplicity.

__NB__ Don't load both, the wrapper is built around the first one and include it.
