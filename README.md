## Simple Browser Terminal Simulator
#### \*NIX Like Terminal For Browser use

####Â Why?
I needed a simple terminal to use on one of my project just for presentation purposes and some fun uses,
didn't find something light and easy as I wanted so here it comes.

There are basic commands but you can easily extend them on plugin init, \n
Want more? There is a simple dir/file (Fake) filesystem and you can pass a custm one too as an object.

PureJS, No Depencies, No styling included you must style it yourself :)
There is just a very basic styling in the test.html file just for testing purposes.

#### install

    bower install browser-terminal.js

####  USAGE

    <div id="terminal_container"></div>
    <script src="terminal.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var custom_commands = {
        custom: "CUSTOM!!!",
      }
      var custom_filesystem = {
        "testingCustomFs":{
          "file": "Im a file",
          "nestedDir": {
